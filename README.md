## Simple MCP Server Application

This is a simple MCP test, where MCP stands for Model Context Protocol, in which an AI system, particularly large language models (LLMs) connect to and interact with external tools, data, and software systems.

#### How to perform a simple test

Run the server in one terminal window manually:
`npm run dev`
In another terminal window, use netcat or the test client:
`npx ts-node src/test-client.ts`
